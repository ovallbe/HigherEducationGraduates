#Workings

This file should keep all my progress and the steps done to achieve the project. 


###Tools

My main idea was to do this with some programming language, but at the moment my Python knowledge is quite primitive and I will try to do this in R. 

For this reason I will have to base this in my R and Excel knowledge (because the data use to be stored in excel files). 
Using Macros for the Excel files is also another option.
