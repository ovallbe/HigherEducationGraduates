Obtaining the data for the Higher Education Graduates of the Catalan Students

This is a personal project to practice with R, Python and Github. 
First, and as a reminder, on this three links should help me to write this Readme. 
[1](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics),[2](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github), [3](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). 

The objective of this work is to obtain and release the existing data of the AQU survey to the Higher Education Graduates of the Catalan Universities. 

Every 3 years the public institituon AQU (University Quality Agency) make a big survey  among all the students who graduate 3 years ago in a Higher Education institiuon. The survey is focussed in the working situation of the graduates 3 years after graduating. 
As [resumed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByO2OczyC7ZbcUNwSUUzZWVwem8/edit?usp=sharing) in my previous experience with this survey 

>The Agency for the Quality of the University System in Catalonia (AQU) jointly with the catalan universities perform every three years >a joint survey of employ-ment of its graduates to learn, among other things, the time, the quality and ways of its insertion, and to >know their degree of satisfaction with the training received. The project, which for the last existing survey include all the >univer-sities (public and private) uses an harmonized methodology used to compare and integrate the information and extract reliable >conclusions in reference to the situation in Catalonia.
>The 2011 edition involved all the catalan universities and represent the largest analysis of its kind ever undertaken in the European >Union. With a population of 28.616 graduates in 2006-2007 and a sample of 16.182 interviewed people.

The survey is done by a public institution, to a students of public (and some private) universities in a matter of public interest.  However the survey itself is not available in a Open Data format. For this reason my aim is to merge all the public data of this survey and release them for the public. 

My technical background in R and in Python that could help to extract and merge all of this information are, for the time being, limited to the courses "Computing for Data Analysis", "Data analysis" and "Getting and cleaning data" from Coursera, the first 25 lessons of [learn python the hardway](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and I am going to begin the course "An introduction to interactive programming in Python" also from Coursera.
I have also quite experience in SQL and Access, some knowledge of VBA and a deep domain of Excel. 

>The next step should be go to the workings document.
